# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Honestly I had to get my syntax double checked, it stress me out sometimes.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
I take notes during lectures and important vocab stuff. Otherwise I copy and paste code to use later as a "formula" of sorts.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Trying to solve the code first! Google seems to take up a lot of time when it can be super simple.
